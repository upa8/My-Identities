These digital copies can be used as original documents when needed as they are government certified.
						Myidenties also features an inbuilt “Go++” feature which allows you to store screenshots from your devices, these screenshots can be edited and cropped online while uploading. This feature allows you to carry other documents of yours to be stored under same website and make them easily assessable.
						Myidentities has all the Emergency contact numbers and details of all cities, where it has been launched. We aim to store the emergency contact details of all the cities throughout India to facilitate our users.
						Complete plan of Myidentities has been proposed by Siddharth Gohel.
						We will be launching our Android application soon.
